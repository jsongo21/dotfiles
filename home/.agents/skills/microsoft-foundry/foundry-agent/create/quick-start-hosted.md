# Quick Start: Hosted Foundry Agent

Opinionated happy-path for first-time users creating their first hosted Foundry agent. Safe defaults, minimal decisions.

> **Scope:** Defaults below are applied automatically when the user is silent. The user may override the language or sample explicitly; new-vs-existing Foundry project is handled inline. For anything not covered here, stop and read [create-hosted.md](create-hosted.md).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this when the request is to create a new hosted Foundry agent end-to-end — scaffold, provision, deploy, and smoke-test. Common overrides (language, region, sample, topic, existing project, existing model) are fine; bounce to [create-hosted.md](create-hosted.md) for anything else.

## Quick Reference

| Property | Default (when user is silent) | Override |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------|
| Language / runtime | Python 3.13 (`python_3_13`) | Any of `python_3_13`, `python_3_14`, `dotnet_10` |
| Sample | Featured basic starter for the chosen language (`azd ai agent sample list --featured-only --language <lang> --output json`) | User may name a different featured sample |
| Subscription | `az account show` | User may supply |
| Region | `northcentralus` | Ask user to confirm or pick another |
| Foundry project | Ask if the user doesn't mention one | create new → no `--project-id`; existing → pass `--project-id` (ARM ID / endpoint); no mention → stop and ask (existing vs new) |
| Model deployment | Whatever the sample's manifest declares | If user supplies a deployment name, `azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` after init |
| Deploy mode | `code` (no Docker, no ACR build) | — |
| Stops at | Deployed agent + remote smoke invoke + eval generation submitted | — |

## Workflow

Walk through every step in order. **Before Step 2**, scan the user's original prompt for any of these values: project name, language, subscription, region, existing Foundry project endpoint or ARM ID, existing model deployment name, agent topic/purpose. **Do not ask** for anything already supplied.

### Step 1 — Verify the environment

Two pre-flight checks — run each script and act on its `[OK]` / `[WARN]` / `[ACTION]` summary prefixes.

**1a — Canvas-first entry (GitHub Copilot app).** Detects whether the runtime is the GitHub Copilot app (`AI_AGENT=github_copilot_app_agent`) and the Foundry Agent Canvas extension is installed. If both are true, the canvas must be opened first so the user can authenticate and select a Foundry project before scaffolding. Run this check first (it can short-circuit the rest). **Skip 1a** if the user opts out, e.g. "skip the canvas" / "use the CLI".

```bash
./scripts/check-canvas-entry.sh     # macOS / Linux
./scripts/check-canvas-entry.ps1    # Windows (pwsh)
```

- **No `[ACTION]`** (only `[OK]`/`[WARN]`) — the gate doesn't apply (not in the Copilot app, or the canvas isn't installed). Continue to 1b.
- **`[ACTION]`** — the gate applies. If the user message's `<canvas-context>` already lists **`canvas="agent-builder"`**, the user has already driven the canvas — continue to 1b using their prompt/config (loop guard, independent of prompt wording). Otherwise `open_canvas` (`canvasId: "agent-builder"`), ask the user to **create the agent from the canvas: sign in, select a subscription + Foundry project, then Send**, then **stop — do not run 1b or scaffold**.

**1b — Tooling & auth.** Run the bundled script:

```bash
./scripts/verify-environment.sh     # macOS / Linux
./scripts/verify-environment.ps1    # Windows (pwsh)
```

Act on the summary prefixes:

- `[OK]` -- nothing to do.
- `[WARN]` -- non-blocking; continue.
- `[ACTION]` -- resolve first, then rerun the script. If `az` or `azd` is missing, ask before installing in interactive mode; install directly in non-interactive mode. For how to install `azd`, see <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd>. In any mode, never run `az login` or `azd auth login`; stop and ask the user to log in manually before any init, provision, or deploy command. Missing `azure.ai.agents` / `azure.ai.projects` extensions may be resolved with `azd extension install <name>`.

### Step 2 — Collect remaining inputs (one batch)

For any values **not** already in the prompt, ask the rest in a single `AskUserQuestion` round:

| Value | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Project / agent name | `ai-agent-<random6>` (6 lowercase alphanumeric chars) | Used as agent name, service key, and project directory. |
| Language | `python_3_13` | One of `python_3_13`, `python_3_14`, `dotnet_10`. |
| Subscription | `az account show --query id -o tsv` | Must be a GUID. |
| Region | `northcentralus` | Confirm or override. |
| Foundry project | Ask if the user doesn't mention one | User said create new → create a new foundry project (no `--project-id` when running `azd ai agent init`). User gave an existing project → use its ARM resource ID when running `azd ai agent init`. User didn't mention a project at all → stop and ask, offering existing vs new. |
| Existing model deployment? | No (use sample manifest's model) | If Yes: collect the deployment name. |

If the user supplied only a **Foundry project endpoint** (not an ARM ID), resolve the ARM ID before Step 5:

```bash
./scripts/resolve-project-id.sh --endpoint "<foundry-project-endpoint>"     # macOS / Linux
./scripts/resolve-project-id.ps1 -Endpoint "<foundry-project-endpoint>"     # Windows (pwsh)
```

Use the returned `id` value. Never guess or construct the ARM ID from the endpoint.

### Step 3 — Pick the sample

```bash
azd ai agent sample list --featured-only --language <lang> --output json
```

> `--language` here takes the short form (`python`, `dotnetCsharp`) — not the runtime token (`python_3_13` fails with `unknown language`). The runtime tokens are only used in Step 5's `azd ai agent init --runtime ...`.

Pick the basic starter (e.g. `azd-ai-starter-basic` for Python — avoid samples with `parameters:` blocks requiring secrets). Capture the `manifestUrl`.

Step 5 needs `--runtime` and `--entry-point` values. These are CLI args, **not** fields in the manifest — use these standard defaults for the chosen language:

| Language | `--runtime` | `--entry-point` |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Python | `python_3_13` | `main.py` |
| .NET | `dotnet_10` | `MyAgent.dll` |

### Step 4 — Create the project directory

```bash
mkdir <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

### Step 5 — Scaffold the agent

Run `azd ai agent init`. `azd ai agent init` is sufficient to create new Foundry projects (or reuse an existing one) and create new Foundry agents. By default, you do not need to run `azd init` unless the user has specific initialization requirements.

```bash
azd ai agent init --no-prompt \
  -m "<manifestUrl>" \
  --deploy-mode code \
  --runtime python_3_13 \
  --entry-point main.py \
  --agent-name <project>
```

Immediately after init, write the subscription and region collected in Step 2 to the active azd environment:

```bash
azd env set \
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<id>" \
  AZURE_LOCATION="<region>"
```

Values you **must** substitute from Step 3 — do not pass placeholders or guesses:

- `--runtime`: exactly one of `python_3_13`, `python_3_14`, `dotnet_10` (the bare value `python` fails with `--runtime must be one of: python_3_13, python_3_14, dotnet_10`).
- `--entry-point`: the entry-point file the sample declares (e.g. `main.py`, not `app.py` — a wrong value scaffolds correctly but breaks local run and deploy).

If using an existing Foundry project, add `--project-id "<arm-id>"`.

⏳ May take time — init resolves the model catalog server-side. Wait for the prompt to return; do not interrupt.

`init` writes `azure.yaml` (appending the agent service), `src/<project>/.agentignore`, and the sample source files under `src/<project>/`.

### Step 6 — Customize the scaffolded sample (per user's original intent)

The scaffold is a generic working sample. Edit only what the user's original prompt asked for — touch tools, dependencies, or model config only when the user explicitly asked for external actions, APIs, tools, connectors, data lookup, or a specific model.

Typical changes:

- The agent service's `description:` in `azure.yaml` — update it to match the user's intent (this also feeds Step 14 eval generation).
- `src/<project>/<entry-point>` — update the system prompt / instructions to match the user's intent.

Only when the user explicitly asked for it:

- Add or modify tool / function-calling code in `<entry-point>`.
- Add dependencies to `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` (Python) or `*.csproj` (.NET).
- Change the model in `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` before Step 9 provision.

If the user's original prompt was generic (no specific agent purpose described), skip customization and ship the sample as-is.

### Step 7 — Write the agent instruction file (required)

Do **not** skip this. The project needs a marker in its `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` in Claude Code) so future prompts reload this skill. If no such file exists, create it with the marker below. If the file already exists, weave the marker into the existing content naturally so it matches the file's structure and tone, rather than bluntly appending a standalone line that reads as out of place. Never overwrite the file or create a second one.

### Step 8 — Sanity-check the scaffold

Verify all four before continuing. If any check fails, pick **one** recovery path, then re-verify:

| Check | Expected | If failed |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` | Non-empty array with `name`, `model.{name,format,version}`, `sku.{name,capacity}` | Model resolution deferred — use recovery |
| Agent service `environmentVariables` `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` (in `azure.yaml`) | Literal name **or** `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}` substitution | If literal `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` (double braces): use recovery |
| Agent service `codeConfiguration.entryPoint:` (in `azure.yaml`) | Matches a real file in `src/<project>/` (e.g. `main.py` and `main.py` exists) | If mismatch (e.g. `entryPoint: app.py` but only `main.py` exists): edit `azure.yaml` to the real filename, then re-verify. Most often caused by passing a wrong `--entry-point` in Step 5. |
| `azure.yaml services:` keys | Only one `<project>` entry | If `<project>-2` exists: init was re-run; use recovery |

**Recovery paths** (pick based on whether Step 6 has already customized `src/<project>/`):

1. **Hand-fix in place** *(use when Step 6 customization is already done — preserves user code)* — edit `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` to add the model block, replace `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` in the agent service's `environmentVariables` with `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`, then `azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME <deployment-name>`.
2. **Clean re-init** *(use only when Step 6 has not run yet — destructive: deletes `src/<project>/`)* — delete `src/<project>/`, remove the `services.<project>:` block from `azure.yaml`, re-run Step 5.
3. **Interactive overwrite** *(loses Step 6 edits — re-resolves the model from the original manifest)* — re-run Step 5 *without* `--no-prompt`. When the collision prompt appears, **arrow-up to "Overwrite existing"** (default is *not* overwrite).

Never `azd env set AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS '[...]'` (single-escaped JSON breaks Bicep parse). Never `az cognitiveservices account deployment create` against this account (creates the deployment outside the azd lifecycle).

If recovery still fails → escape to [create-hosted.md](create-hosted.md).

### Step 9 — Provision Azure resources

> 🚦 **Project-selection gate (align with Step 2).** Only `azd provision` a new project when the user asked to create one. If the user gave an existing project, skip provision and use it. If the user didn't mention a project at all, stop and ask first — don't silently provision a new one.

```bash
azd provision --no-state --no-prompt
```

`--no-state` skips the existing-deployment check; safe here because the golden path starts from a fresh environment (Step 5). Keep it for this quickstart; you can omit it later when re-provisioning the same environment.

⏳ May take time — creates the resource group, Foundry account + project, model deployment, App Insights, Log Analytics. Wait for the prompt to return; do not interrupt.

### Step 10 — Wire local env vars

```bash
azd env get-values
```

Capture `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`. Write `src/<project>/.env`:

```env
FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>
AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<deployment-name>
```

Also mirror them into the azd env (so `azd ai agent run` injects the right values — it reads azd env *before* `.env`):

```bash
azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT "<endpoint>"
azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "<deployment-name>"
```

### Step 11 — Local smoke test

Set up a venv with `uv` installed first. `azd ai agent run` installs Python dependencies on first start; with an activated venv that has `uv` available, it uses `uv` (seconds) instead of plain `pip` (minutes).

> **Important:** the venv must live in `src/<project>/` (next to `requirements.txt`). `azd ai agent run` resolves the venv relative to the service source directory; a venv at the project root is ignored and azd silently creates a second one without `uv`, wasting the speedup.

**Python:**
```bash
cd src/<project>
python -m venv .venv
# Activate the venv — pick the line for your shell:
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1                    # Windows pwsh
source .venv/bin/activate                       # macOS / Linux
python -m pip install uv
cd -                                             # back to project root for the azd commands below
```

**.NET:** no pre-install step — `azd ai agent run` runs `dotnet restore` itself on first start.

Run the agent locally. For Python, do this **with the service-dir venv still activated** — activation is what lets `azd ai agent run` find `uv` for the fast dependency install. `azd ai agent run` **is** the local server — a foreground process holding port 8088 that must stay alive from start, through every `invoke --local`, until you explicitly stop it.

Start it in a **managed** background session your shell tool can poll and stop (most tools detect a long-running foreground process and return a session/shell id — use that id). Do **not** use job operators (`bash &`, `nohup`, `start /B`, popped windows): on Linux/macOS the child gets `SIGHUP` and **dies when its parent bash exits**, so the next command sees `could not connect` even though `ss` from inside the *same* bash just showed `:8088` bound.

> ⚠️ **Readiness gate — do not skip.** After starting `azd ai agent run`, **watch the server log for the ready line, something like `Running` (e.g. `Running on http://0.0.0.0:8088`) — not just `Starting …`**, which azd prints as a banner before the Python process has bound the socket. Invoking before the socket is bound fails with `could not connect`.
> - **Never invoke before the most recent log read shows the ready line.** Premature invokes waste a poll cycle and return a misleading `could not connect`.
> - **Poll short — 2–5s per read.** Boot time is unbounded; long sleeps cost wall-clock directly. No 15s+ blocks or `sleep N` waits.
> - **Don't substitute log polling** with `sleep N && curl`, `netstat` / `ss` / `lsof`, or `ps aux` probes — only the log tells you readiness.
> - **If `invoke --local` fails,** re-read the server log. Error before the ready line (missing env var, auth, port in use) → fix the cause and restart `azd ai agent run` in the managed session. Ready line present but request still fails → the issue is in the request, not the server. Either way, do **not** bypass with `python main.py` or raw `curl POST /responses` — those skip the wiring the deployed agent uses.
> - **If `invoke --local` returns `could not connect` after you saw the ready line in a previous shell,** the server died when that shell exited (classic `&` symptom). Restart in the managed session — do not retry with another `&`.

```bash
azd ai agent run --no-inspector
```

Smoke-invoke (local):

```bash
azd ai agent invoke --local "<short representative prompt for the agent's purpose>"
```

Stop the local server via the managed session's stop primitive before continuing — a lingering process holds files in the project and breaks later cleanup.

### Step 12 — Deploy

```bash
azd deploy --no-prompt
```

⏳ May take time — zips `src/<project>/` (respecting `.agentignore`), uploads to Foundry, builds runtime remotely, registers agent version. Wait for the prompt to return; do not interrupt.

### Step 13 — Verify + remote smoke

```bash
azd ai agent show --output json
```

Expect `"status": "active"` (or `"deployed"`) and an `agent_endpoints` map.

Remote invoke (billed):

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "<short representative prompt>"
```

`azd ai agent invoke` has **no `--force` flag**. If the command succeeds, read the response. If it surfaces a confirmation prompt or message, summarize the cost implication for the user (*"this will call the deployed agent and incur model usage charges"*), get explicit consent, and re-run — do **not** invent flags.

### Step 14 — Submit eval suite generation (async, fire-and-forget)

> ⚠️ **Pre-summary gate.** Do not write the Step 15 final summary until this step has been submitted. The eval suite is part of the deployment artifact; skipping it ships an incomplete result.

Read the agent service's `description:` from `azure.yaml` (the value you set in Step 6) and pass it as `--gen-instruction`:

```bash
azd ai agent eval generate --gen-instruction "<agent service description>" --no-wait --no-prompt
```

Expected output:

```
Eval generate submitted (async)
   dataset generation: datagen-<id> (queued)
   evaluator generation: evaluatorgen-<id> (in_progress)
   Config written to: src/<project>/eval.yaml
   When ready, run:
     azd ai agent eval run
```

Generation runs server-side and takes several minutes. Tell the user:

> *"Eval suite generation submitted. Run `azd ai agent eval run` whenever you're ready — it'll wait for generation to finish and execute the eval in one step."*

### Step 15 — Final summary

Produce a concise summary covering: agent name/version/status/endpoints, a Playground link, the resources created, and the three follow-up commands below. Read `playground_url` directly from `azd ai agent show --output json`. If it is absent, construct the Playground URL from `azd env get-values`:

```
https://ai.azure.com/nextgen/r/{encodedSubId},{resourceGroup},,{accountName},{projectName}/build/agents/{agentName}/build?version={agentVersion}
```

`encodedSubId` = URL-safe base64 of the subscription GUID, padding stripped:

```bash
python -c "import base64,uuid;print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(uuid.UUID('<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>').bytes).rstrip(b'=').decode())"
```

Three follow-up commands to include:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke "<follow-up message>"   # chat with the deployed agent (billed)
azd ai agent eval run                       # finalize + run the eval suite (Step 14)
azd down                                    # tear down all resources when done
```

## Error Handling

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `azd ai agent init` fails with `--runtime must be one of: python_3_13, python_3_14, dotnet_10` | You passed a bare value like `python`. Use the full runtime token (e.g. `python_3_13`). |
| `azd ai agent init` fails with `--entry-point is required when using --deploy-mode code with --no-prompt` | Pass `--entry-point <filename>` matching the entry-point file the sample declares (from Step 3). |
| `codeConfiguration.entryPoint` doesn't match any file in `src/<project>/` | You guessed the entry-point in Step 5. Edit the agent service in `azure.yaml` to the real filename (verify with `ls src/<project>/`). No re-init needed. |
| `azd deploy` postdeploy hook fails with missing `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Run `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv` and `azd env set AZURE_TENANT_ID <tenant-id>`, then re-run `azd deploy --no-prompt`. The deployed agent version from the first deploy is still valid; the postdeploy hook just registers env vars. |
| Scaffold sanity check fails (Step 8) | Pick a recovery path from Step 8. If still failing → [create-hosted.md](create-hosted.md). |
| Local invoke returns model `404` / wrong deployment | Stale `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` in azd env overrides `.env`. Re-run Step 10 to sync both. |
| `azd ai agent invoke ... --force` returns `unknown flag: --force` | `--force` is not a valid flag for invoke. Re-run without it. |
| Anything else | Escape to [create-hosted.md](create-hosted.md). |

## Escape Hatch

If any step fails in a way not covered above, the output looks unexpected, or the user's request drifts outside what this quickstart covers → **stop improvising**. Read [create-hosted.md](create-hosted.md) and follow its full workflow.
