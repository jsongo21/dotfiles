# Tool — Work IQ (preview)

Connect an agent to the user's Microsoft 365 work context — email, meetings, files, chats — through **Work IQ**. Work IQ runs as an A2A peer; every request runs in the context of the signed-in user and honors all Microsoft 365 permissions and sensitivity labels.

## Toolbox shape

```json
{
  "type": "work_iq_preview",
  "project_connection_id": "<workiq-connection-name>"
}
```

## Requirements

- A `RemoteA2A` project connection targeting `https://workiq.svc.cloud.microsoft/a2a/`, `authType=OAuth2`, **BYO Entra app only** (no managed OAuth).
- Scopes: `api://workiq.svc.cloud.microsoft/WorkIQAgent.Ask` + `offline_access`. A **Global Administrator** must grant tenant-wide admin consent for `WorkIQAgent.Ask` (Work IQ app ID `fdcc1f02-fc51-4226-8753-f668596af7f7`).
- Each calling end-user must hold a **Microsoft 365 Copilot license**.
- The Work IQ service principal must be pre-provisioned in the tenant (one-time, via Graph Explorer); see the public doc.
- VNet integration is **not** supported — the Foundry project must not use a VNet-restricted endpoint.
