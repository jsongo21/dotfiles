# Canvas-First Entry check for the Foundry "create a new agent" flow.
#
# Reports -- using the same [OK]/[WARN]/[ACTION] convention as verify-environment --
# whether the canvas-first gate applies before scaffolding a new hosted agent in the
# GitHub Copilot app, from two deterministic facts:
#   * copilot_app      - is AI_AGENT=github_copilot_app_agent?
#   * canvas_installed - is the Foundry Agent Canvas (foundry-agent-canvas)
#                        installed in the project, user, or session location?
#
# Output: summary lines, each prefixed with [OK], [WARN], or [ACTION].
# Exit code: 0 when the gate does not apply (not in the app, or the canvas is not
# installed), 1 when the canvas is installed and an [ACTION] is required.
#
# NOTE: whether the canvas is *open* is runtime UI state the agent reads from the
# message <canvas-context> (look for canvas="agent-builder"); a script cannot see it.
