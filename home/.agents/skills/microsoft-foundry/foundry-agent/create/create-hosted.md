# Create Hosted Agent (azd ai)

Scaffold a hosted Foundry agent project with the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) and the `azure.ai.agents` extension. The same flow covers new agents and continued development of existing agents, then drops you into a local inner-loop so you can iterate before deploying.

> **Creating a new agent end-to-end from scratch?** Use [quick-start-hosted.md](quick-start-hosted.md) instead -- an opinionated happy-path with safe defaults. Stay here for anything not covered by the quickstart.

> **Scope:** `azd ai` is the preferred *code-first* path -- use it when the intent is agent code on disk, in a repo, with infrastructure-as-code and a local inner-loop. If the intent is only to create a remote agent resource (no code on disk), other approaches may apply -- for prompt agents see [create-prompt.md](create-prompt.md), or use the Foundry MCP tools / portal.

## Quick Reference

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Agent type | Hosted (container or code) |
| Primary CLI | `azd ai agent` (from extension `azure.ai.agents`) |
| Scaffold command | `azd ai agent init -m <manifestUrl> --deploy-mode code --runtime python_3_13 --entry-point main.py`, pass `--runtime dotnet_10 --entry-point MyAgent.dll` for .NET project (or `--src <dir>` when onboarding existing code) |
| Local run | `azd ai agent run --no-client` + `azd ai agent invoke --local "..."` |
| Deploy handoff | [deploy/deploy.md](../deploy/deploy.md) |
| Sample catalog | `azd ai agent sample list --featured-only --output json` |
| Reference docs | [azd-ai-cli](../azd-guidance/references/azd-ai-cli.md), [local-run](references/local-run.md), [toolbox.md](../toolbox/toolbox.md) |

## When to Use This Skill

- Create a new hosted agent from a curated Foundry sample.
- Continue developing on an existing agent project (Python, .NET).
- Add tools (web search, AI Search, MCP, A2A) to a hosted agent.
- Run and iterate on a hosted agent locally before deploying.

For prompt agents (LLM + instructions, no container), use [create-prompt.md](create-prompt.md). For deploy, use [deploy.md](../deploy/deploy.md).

## Hosted vs Prompt

| | Hosted | Prompt |
|--|--------|--------|
| Custom Python / .NET code? | Yes -> this skill | No -> [create-prompt.md](create-prompt.md) |
| Tools / RAG / MCP / A2A | Toolbox + connections | Built-in tool configs |
| Local debugging | `azd ai agent run --no-client` | Limited |
| Output | New immutable agent version per `azd deploy` | `agent_update` via MCP / SDK |

## Workflow

### Step 1 -- Verify the environment

Run the bundled Copilot app entry preflight directly without asking for approval. It detects the GitHub Copilot app and installs app-specific add-ons only in that environment:

```bash
./scripts/check-copilot-app-entry.sh     # macOS / Linux
./scripts/check-copilot-app-entry.ps1    # Windows (pwsh)
```

Then run the bundled verification script before any create/deploy command:

```bash
./scripts/verify-environment.sh     # macOS / Linux
./scripts/verify-environment.ps1    # Windows (pwsh)
```

Do not continue past Step 1 while any `[ACTION]` remains. Never run `az login` or `azd auth login` for the user. Missing authentication is a hard stop before any `azd ai agent init`, `azd provision`, `azd deploy`, or other deploy command.

Act on the summary prefixes:

- `[OK]` -- nothing to do.
- `[WARN]` -- non-blocking; continue.
- `[ACTION]` -- resolve first, then rerun the script. If `az` or `azd` is missing, ask before installing in interactive mode; install directly in non-interactive mode. For how to install `azd`, see <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd>. In any mode, never run `az login` or `azd auth login`; stop and ask the user to log in manually. Missing `azure.ai.agents` / `azure.ai.projects` extensions may be resolved with `azd extension install <name>`. Failed `az` or `azd` auth checks must stop the workflow until the user logs in manually.

Branch on the agent status reported by `verify-environment`:

- `not_deployed` -> Step 2.
- `active` / `deployed` -> for code changes, continue to Step 4b; for deploy-only requests, use [deploy/deploy.md](../deploy/deploy.md); to add a tool, use [toolbox.md](../toolbox/toolbox.md).

### Step 2 -- New or existing Foundry project?

Ask: "Do you want to create a new Foundry project, or use an existing one?" Skip the question when the workspace is already configured as a Foundry hosted agent, or when the prompt supplies an existing project endpoint / project ARM resource ID.

- **New project** -- do NOT pass `--project-id`. `azd provision` (in deploy) will create it.
- **Existing project with ARM resource ID** -- pass that exact ID to `azd ai agent init --project-id`.
- **Existing project with Foundry project endpoint only** -- resolve the project ARM resource ID with the bundled script, then pass the returned `id` to `azd ai agent init --project-id`:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/resolve-project-id.sh --endpoint "<foundry-project-endpoint>"     # macOS / Linux
  ./scripts/resolve-project-id.ps1 -Endpoint "<foundry-project-endpoint>"     # Windows (pwsh)
  ```
- **Existing project with neither endpoint nor ARM ID** -- ask for the ARM resource ID.

Do not guess, derive, or construct the project ID from the endpoint. For `--project-id`, pass either the user-supplied project ARM resource ID or the `id` returned by Azure lookup / the bundled resolve script.

> `azd ai agent init` initializes both the azd project and its environment. Run it directly in the target directory. For an existing Foundry project, also pass `--project-id <arm-id>`.

### Step 3 -- Choose the starting point

| User has ... | Use |
|--------------|-----|
| Empty workspace, or wants a starter | **New agent** -- Step 4a |
| Existing agent project or source code | **Existing agent** -- Step 4b |

If unsure, inspect the workspace and user intent. Never guess a manifest URL by hand.

### Step 4a -- New agent: scaffold from a sample

List the curated catalog (filter by language if known):

```bash
azd ai agent sample list --featured-only --language python --output json
```

Each entry has a `manifestUrl` and an `initCommand`. Prefer code deployment. `azd ai agent init` defaults to code deployment.

For a generic new hosted agent request, start from the basic sample. Use tool/function-calling samples only when the user explicitly asks for external actions, APIs, tools, connectors, or data lookup.

Run `azd ai agent init`. `azd ai agent init` is sufficient to create new Foundry projects (or reuse an existing one) and create new Foundry agents. By default, you do not need to run `azd init` unless the user has specific initialization requirements.

Python Example (add `--project-id "<resourceId>"` for an existing Foundry project; add `--agent-name <name>` if the user wants a custom name -- omit otherwise to keep the sample default):

```bash
azd ai agent init --no-prompt \
  -m "<manifestUrl>" \
  --deploy-mode code \
  --runtime python_3_13 \
  --entry-point main.py
```

Immediately after init, set the collected subscription and location on the active azd environment:

```bash
azd env set \
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>" \
  AZURE_LOCATION="<region>"
```

> `--agent-name` at init sets both the `azure.yaml` service key and its `name:` in one shot; renaming after init requires editing both in `azure.yaml`.

Do not run `azd env new`, `azd env select`, or `azd env set` before `azd ai agent init` in a new temp/workspace; there is no azd project yet, so those commands fail and waste time. For an existing project, `--project-id` is enough during init. Set endpoint/model values immediately after init, once `azure.yaml` and the azd env exist.

> Tip: if the manifest declares a `parameters:` block (check by `curl <manifestUrl>`), collect required values before init when an azd project already exists. In a new empty workspace, prefer a sample without required secrets; there is no azd env to set until init creates the project files.

`init` writes `azure.yaml` (or appends the agent service to it), the agent source under `src/<name>/`, and `<service-dir>/.agentignore`. A successful direct-code init produces an `azure.yaml` service block (`host: azure.ai.agent`) with `codeConfiguration:`. For file shapes, see [azd-ai-cli](../azd-guidance/references/azd-ai-cli.md).

#### Model deployments (azd Golden Path)

`azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` is the **single source of truth** for model deployments in azd-managed Foundry projects. Model deployments live under the dedicated `ai-project` service (`host: azure.ai.project`); the agent service links to it via `uses: [ai-project]` and references the model through its `environmentVariables`. The flow is:

```
manifest → azd ai agent init → azure.yaml ai-project deployments[] → AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS env (internal) → Bicep → Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments
```

Rules:

- **`azd ai agent init` writes `services.ai-project.deployments[]` from the sample's manifest** and also sets `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` to the first deployment's `name`. `azd provision` then creates the deployment through Bicep. No `az` calls are needed in the Golden Path.
- **`deployments[].name` is the literal Azure deployment resource name** — not a label, not a placeholder. Use a human-readable model name (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). **Never** use the literal string `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` as the `name` value; doing so creates a deployment literally named `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` and the agent will 404 on its first invoke.
- **Adding a *second* model (or any change to `services.ai-project.deployments[]`) to an existing project:** edit `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` directly (and update the agent service's `environmentVariables` `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` if the new entry should become the default), then run `azd provision`. The extension's `preprovision` hook calls `envUpdate` automatically, which re-marshals the deployments and re-writes `AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS` with the correct double-escaping before Bicep runs. **Do not re-run `azd ai agent init`** for this case — it triggers the non-idempotent collision flow (see anti-patterns) and at best (with explicit "Overwrite existing") re-resolves models from the original manifest rather than merging your edit.
- **Agent `environmentVariables`: prefer `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}` over a hardcoded model name.** The `${VAR}` form is resolved from the active azd env at run / deploy time, so a single `azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME <name>` (or env switch dev → prod) updates the agent without touching the file. Init writes this form by default; only the literal `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` (double braces) is a failure marker that means model resolution deferred.
- **Recovery: `services.ai-project.deployments[]` is empty or the agent service's `environmentVariables` have the literal `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` placeholder.** First verify the active azd environment has the intended subscription and location. Then pick **one** of these three paths — init is **not** idempotent:
  1. **Clean re-init (preferred when no user code has been added to `src/<name>/` yet):** delete `src/<name>/`, remove the `services.<name>:` block from `azure.yaml`, then re-run `azd ai agent init`. No collision, scaffolds cleanly with the resolved model.
  2. **Interactive overwrite:** re-run `azd ai agent init` **without `--no-prompt`**. When the collision prompt appears, **actively arrow-up and select "Overwrite existing"** — the default selection is *not* overwrite (it's "Use a different service name", which produces `<name>-2`).
  3. **Hand-fix in place (preserves any user code in `src/<name>/`):** edit `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` to add the model block (`name`, `model.{name, format, version}`, `sku.{name, capacity}`), replace the literal `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` in the agent service's `environmentVariables` with `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}`, then `azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME <deployment-name>`. Run `azd provision`; the `preprovision` hook auto-syncs `AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS`.
- **Anti-patterns — do not do these:**
  - **Blindly re-running `azd ai agent init` against an existing project.** Under `--no-prompt` init silently auto-suffixes (`<service>-2`, then `-3`, ...) via `nextAvailableName`; in interactive mode the collision prompt's default is "Use a different service name". There is **no flag** (`--force` does not apply here) to make `--no-prompt` overwrite. Use one of the three recovery paths above.
  - `azd env set AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS '[...]'` — `AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS` is internal extension state. The extension writes it with double-escaped JSON (`\\` and `\"`) required by Bicep parameter substitution; `azd env set` only single-escapes and breaks the parse with `invalid character 'n' after object key:value pair`.
  - `az cognitiveservices account deployment create ...` against the azd-managed Foundry account — creates the deployment outside the azd lifecycle, so `azd provision` won't manage it and `azd down` won't clean it up. Use `az cognitiveservices` (or [models/deploy-model](../../models/deploy-model/SKILL.md)) **only** for shared/pre-existing Foundry projects that are not managed by this azd project.
  - Hand-patching the `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` placeholder in the agent service's `environmentVariables` *without also* adding the matching entry to `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` — the agent will reference a deployment name that Bicep never created. Use the [hand-fix recovery path](#model-deployments-azd-golden-path) above (path #3) which fixes both together.

Check the scaffold before local run:

1. **Verify `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` is non-empty** and that the agent service's `environmentVariables` `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` is a literal value or the `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}` substitution form — **not** the double-brace literal `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` (that placeholder is the marker that init deferred model resolution). Also confirm `azure.yaml` has only **one** service entry for your agent — a duplicate `<name>-2` means a previous init re-ran against the existing project (collision prompt default + `--no-prompt` silent auto-suffix; see anti-patterns above). If either condition fails, use one of the three [recovery paths in the anti-patterns section](#model-deployments-azd-golden-path) (clean re-init / interactive overwrite / hand-fix). Do **not** `azd env set AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS`.
2. If the user supplied an existing project endpoint, project ARM ID, or model deployment name, set them in the active azd env and verify the values. `azd ai agent run` injects azd env values before `.env`, so a stale `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` can override a correct `.env` file.
   ```bash
   azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT "<project-endpoint>"
   azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID "<project-arm-id>"
   azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME "<model-deployment-name>"
   azd env get-values
   ```
3. Create the agent source `.env` with the same endpoint and model deployment values:
   ```env
   FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>
   AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<model-deployment-name>
   ```
4. Prefer `--agent-name` at init time (above). Fallback only: if init already ran without it, rename the `azure.yaml` service key AND its `name:` to the same value, preserving its `project:` path.
5. If you change CPU or memory, set it in the agent service's `container.resources` in `azure.yaml`.

### Step 4b -- Existing agent: continue development

Use when the workspace already contains an agent project or source code.

First determine whether the workspace is already a Foundry hosted agent project.

- **Existing Foundry hosted agent** -- preserve its project structure, make the requested changes, and continue.
- **Other existing agent** -- infer whether the user wants to re-host it on Foundry and ask only when the intended outcome is unclear. If re-hosting, follow the Re-host steps below.

#### Re-host: collect information

Resolve two independent choices before initialization or edits:

1. **Model** -- keep the existing model or use a Foundry model.
2. **Agent framework** -- keep the existing framework or migrate it.

Infer these choices from the user's request and current code. Ask only for information that remains unclear; skip questions when the intent is explicit or evident, such as an existing Foundry model integration. Do not switch or deploy a model, or migrate the framework, without user intent.

#### Re-host: adapt and initialize

Use `azd ai agent sample list --language <language> --output json` to find the closest relevant sample for adapter, protocol, and deployment guidance. Treat samples as boundary patterns, not replacement applications.

After resolving the choices, run:

```bash
azd ai agent init --no-prompt \
  --src ./src/my-agent \
  --agent-name my-agent \
  --deploy-mode code \
  --runtime python_3_13 \
  --entry-point <entry-point>
```

`--runtime` and `--entry-point` are required with `--deploy-mode code --no-prompt`. Use the existing executable entry point, or a new adapter file only when one is intentionally added. Runtimes: `python_3_13`, `python_3_14`, `dotnet_10`. `--deploy-mode container` builds from `Dockerfile`. For an existing Foundry project, add `--project-id "<resourceId>"`.

Once the agent is configured as a Foundry hosted agent, make the requested changes and continue to the shared flow in Steps 5-8.

### Step 5 -- Write the agent instruction file (required)

Applies to both 4a and 4b, and to any existing project you touch (not just fresh scaffolds). Do **not** skip this. The project needs a marker in its `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md` in Claude Code) so future prompts reload this skill. If no such file exists, create it with the marker below. If the file already exists, weave the marker into the existing content naturally so it matches the file's structure and tone, rather than bluntly appending a standalone line that reads as out of place. Never overwrite the file or create a second one.

```
This project was built with the microsoft-foundry skill. Before working on or answering questions about foundry agents, read the microsoft-foundry skill first.
```

### Step 6 -- Run locally and iterate

Read and follow [local-run](references/local-run.md). Complete one representative local invocation before deploying.

### Step 7 -- Add capabilities (optional)

Optionally add toolboxes (tools), guardrails (content safety), and skills (behavioral guidelines) before deploying.

### Step 7a -- Add tools (optional)

**Recommend attaching tool through a toolbox**
Preferred over wiring MCP servers/connections directly to the agent: it centralizes auth and policy and lets you change tools without touching agent code. Supported: MCP servers, Web Search, Bing Search, Azure AI Search, Code Interpreter, File Search, OpenAPI APIs, A2A, Work IQ, Fabric IQ, Browser Automation — see the toolbox sub-skill [toolbox.md § Supported tool types](../toolbox/toolbox.md#supported-tool-types) for per-type auth and setup guides.

#### Toolbox creation boundary

> 🚦 **Creating the toolbox/connection:** write the **full agent-side code** that consumes the toolbox (not just an env var). The **only** thing you leave out is the toolbox configs (for example name/endpoint/connection): put placeholders there, and explicitly tell the user to create the toolbox/connection in [Foundry Toolkit (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/intelligentapps/tool-catalog) or the [Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com/) and write the real values back. Create the toolbox/connection yourself only when the user explicitly asks you to (or supplies the real values).

Flow (only when the user asks you to create the toolbox):

1. Create the **connection** (`azd ai connection create ...`).
2. Create or update the **toolbox** (`azd ai toolbox create` / `connection add`).
3. Set the agent env var (`azd env set TOOLBOX_ENDPOINT ...`).
4. Reference it in the agent service's `environmentVariables` in `azure.yaml`.
5. `azd deploy`.

For what a toolbox is and how to create one (concept, tool types, the create flow), see the toolbox sub-skill [toolbox.md](../toolbox/toolbox.md). For generating the agent code that consumes a toolbox, see [use-toolbox-in-hosted-agent.md](references/use-toolbox-in-hosted-agent.md).

### Step 7b -- Add guardrails (optional)

Attach a content-safety guardrail to the agent or its toolbox. See [guardrail-manage](references/guardrails/guardrail-manage.md) for creating policies and [guardrail-attach](references/guardrails/guardrail-attach.md) for wiring them to agents, model deployments, or toolboxes.

### Step 7c -- Add skills (optional)

Attach reusable behavioral guidelines (skills) to the agent via the toolbox. See [skill-manage](references/skills/skill-manage.md) for creating and versioning skills, [skill-toolbox-attach](references/skills/skill-toolbox-attach.md) for attaching skills to a toolbox, and [skill-attach](references/skills/skill-attach.md) for consuming skills in agent code.

### Step 8 -- Hand off to deploy

Once local invocation succeeds, tell the user the agent is ready and ask if they want to deploy. Read [deploy/deploy.md](../deploy/deploy.md).

## Expected env-var fingerprint (post-provision)

After `azd provision` completes for an `azd ai agent`-scaffolded project (default Basic Agent Setup), `azd env get-values` should show this canonical state. Verify before debugging deployment or runtime issues.

| Variable | Expected value | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| `ENABLE_HOSTED_AGENTS` | `true` | Set automatically by `azd ai agent init`. |
| `ENABLE_CAPABILITY_HOST` | `false` | Set automatically by `azd ai agent init`. Leave as-is unless you are intentionally targeting Standard Agent Setup. |
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | `https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>` | Populated by provision (or pre-set if reusing an existing project). |
| `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID` | Full ARM resource ID of the Foundry project | Populated by provision; required for deploy. |
| `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` | Model deployment name (e.g. `gpt-4o`) | Set automatically by `azd ai agent init` from the first entry in `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]`. Required for local run and deploy. |
| `AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS` | escaped JSON array, e.g. `[{\"name\":\"gpt-4o\",...}]` | **Internal extension state.** Managed by `azd ai agent init` from `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]`. Carries deployments into the Bicep parameter `aiProjectDeploymentsJson`. **Never** set with `azd env set` — manual edits single-escape the JSON and break Bicep `json()` parsing. |
| `AI_AGENT_PENDING_PROVISION` | *(empty / unset)* | Non-empty means provision is still mid-flight; do not deploy. |

`Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/capabilityHosts/agents` is **not** provisioned by `azd ai agent init` (Basic Agent Setup). Its absence is expected. The resource only appears under Standard Agent Setup, which is documented separately in [references/standard-agent-setup.md](../../references/standard-agent-setup.md).

Both `ENABLE_HOSTED_AGENTS` and `ENABLE_CAPABILITY_HOST` are set automatically by `azd ai agent init` — you do not need to manage them. If you ever set them manually outside this flow, see [project/create/create-foundry-project.md](../../project/create/create-foundry-project.md#step-3-create-directory-and-initialize) for the manual-flag procedure.

See the canonical env-var registry: [azure-dev/cli/azd/docs/environment-variables.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/main/cli/azd/docs/environment-variables.md).

## Common Guidelines

1. **Sample-first** -- always get `manifestUrl` from `azd ai agent sample list`.
2. **Prefer azd over az** -- fall back to `az` only as a last resort, with explicit consent.
3. **Don't auto-login** -- `az login` and `azd auth login` are user-owned browser flows; ask the user and stop.
4. **JSON output** -- add `--output json` only to read-only `azd ai agent` commands such as `show`. Do not add it to `azd ai agent invoke`; invoke supports `default` and `raw`, not `json`.
5. **One file** -- the agent is defined as a service block in `azure.yaml` (`host: azure.ai.agent`). See [azd-ai-cli](../azd-guidance/references/azd-ai-cli.md).
6. **Reserved env vars** -- `FOUNDRY_*` and `AGENT_*` are platform-injected at runtime; `AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS`, `AI_PROJECT_RESOURCES`, and `AI_PROJECT_TOOL_CONNECTIONS` are extension-managed transport for Bicep. Never set any of these with `azd env set` -- edit `azure.yaml` and re-run `azd ai agent init`.

## Non-Interactive / YOLO Mode

> Even in `--no-prompt` / `--yolo` mode, don't skip these two:
> - **Project:** if the user named a project or asked to create one, go ahead; otherwise stop and ask before provisioning.
> - **Toolbox/connection:** create it only when the user asked you to; otherwise leave the configs as placeholders and ask.

Defaults when unspecified: greenfield + Python + `azd ai agent sample list --featured-only --language python`, choose the simplest recommended sample that matches the request, plus `--no-prompt` on every write. Always set the subscription and location after init as shown in Step 4a. If creating a new project and the user did not provide a project name, auto-generate one using the pattern `ai-project-<random>` (6-8 lowercase alphanumeric characters). Show the generated name to the user but do not block on confirmation. If using an existing project, ensure `azd ai agent init` receives `--project-id`: use the supplied ARM ID, or run the Step 2 resolve script for the supplied Foundry project endpoint and pass the returned `id`. If the user did not ask to create a new project and did not supply an existing one (ARM ID / endpoint), stop and ask which to use before provisioning. If `az` or `azd` is missing, ask before installing in interactive mode; install directly in non-interactive mode. In any mode, never run `az login` or `azd auth login`; stop and ask the user to log in manually before re-running Step 1. If the manifest declares secret parameters, collect them with `ask_user` and set them via `azd env set PARAM_...` before init -- keep `--no-prompt` (do not fall into azd's interactive prompts).

## Error Handling

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `extension not installed` | `azd extension install azure.ai.agents` |
| `not_logged_in` / `login_expired` | Ask user to run `az login` and `azd auth login`; never run those commands for them. |
| `unknown flag: --subscription` / `--location` on `azd ai agent init` | After init, set both values with `azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<id> AZURE_LOCATION=<region>`. |
| the agent service's `environmentVariables` contain literal `{{AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}}` placeholder after init | Init deferred model resolution. **Do not blindly re-run init** (default prompt = `<name>-2`; `--no-prompt` silently auto-suffixes). Pick one of the three [recovery paths](#model-deployments-azd-golden-path): clean re-init after deleting `src/<name>/`, interactive overwrite, or hand-fix `azure.yaml` + replace `{{...}}` with `${AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}` and `azd env set AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME <name>`, then `azd provision`. |
| `azure.yaml` has duplicate `<service>-2` entry after re-running init | Init is not idempotent: interactive default is "Use a different service name" and `--no-prompt` silently appends `-2`. To recover, delete the `<service>-2` entry from `azure.yaml`, remove `src/<service>-2/`, then `azd provision`. |
| `invalid character 'n' after object key:value pair` during `azd provision` | You used `azd env set AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS '[...]'` (single-escaped JSON breaks Bicep `json()`). Clear it (`azd env set AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS ""`), declare the deployment in `azure.yaml services.ai-project.deployments[]` instead, then re-run `azd provision` (its `preprovision` hook re-syncs `AI_PROJECT_DEPLOYMENTS` with the correct double-escaping). |
| `missing_project_endpoint` | Run `azd provision`, or `azd env set AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT <url>` |
| `project_not_found` | cwd has no `azure.yaml`; move to project root or run init |
| Secret parameter prompt under `--no-prompt` | In an empty workspace, choose a simpler sample without secret parameters. In an existing azd project, set `PARAM_<CONN>_<KEY>` with `azd env set` before init; keep `--no-prompt`. |
| `cannot use --version with --local` | Drop `--version`, or drop `--local` to hit the deployed agent |
| `could not detect project type` | Set `startupCommand` in `azure.yaml` or pass `--start-command` |
| Local run issue | Follow [local-run](references/local-run.md) common failures |

Run `azd ai agent doctor --output json` to surface failing checks with `suggestion` fields.
