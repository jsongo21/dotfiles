# Professional Communication

Write emails and Slack messages that are direct, concise, and casually warm.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Direct**: Get to the point quickly. Lead with the ask or key info.
- **Concise**: Short sentences. No fluff or filler phrases.
- **Warm but not over-the-top**: Friendly without being sycophantic. A brief "Hope you're well" is fine; drawn-out pleasantries are not.
- **Casual**: Use contractions (I'm, we'll, can't). First names. No stiff corporate-speak.

## Structure

### Emails
1. Brief greeting (one line max)
2. Purpose/ask upfront
3. Context or details (only what's needed)
4. Clear next step or call to action
5. Short sign-off

### Slack Messages
- Even more concise than email
- Skip greetings for ongoing threads
- Use bullet points for multiple items
- Bold key actions or deadlines

## Avoid

- "Just following up" / "Just checking in" - say what you actually need
- "Per my last email" - passive aggressive
- "Please advise" - vague and formal
- Excessive exclamation marks
- Long preambles before getting to the point
- "Hope this finds you well" - overused

## Good Examples

**Email asking for feedback:**
> Hi John Doe,
>
> Could you review the proposal doc by Thursday? Specifically looking for your input on the timeline in section 3.
>
> Happy to jump on a quick call if easier.
>
> Cheers,
> Jason

**Slack message:**
> Hey - quick heads up: the deploy is pushed to tomorrow morning. I'll ping you once it's live.

**Declining a meeting:**
> Thanks for the invite. I'm pretty stretched this week - could we handle this async? Happy to review a doc or answer questions in Slack.
